final: Jack Higgins

I have seen much crazier assignments done in the class and I was unable to finish some goals laid out in my proposal.
Because of this I don't deserve an A, I think I earned an 85% on the project.I feel like I showed understanding of the 
material with regards to lighting, textures and 3D object creation. 

What I am proud of / things to look at:
Textures on buttons and body.
The shape of back used, the rounded edges, the back's game slot.
Lighting

The hole on the side is intentional and is meant to represent where the power button is supposed to go.

"Arrows" : move around scene
"x" : toggle axes
"pgUp" : Zoom in
"PgDn" : Zoom out
"b" : toggle everything but back
